    <strong class="text-2xl">The navigation bar:</strong> <br>
    The menu button will bring up extra options. These are: <br><br>
    The about page. Here you can learn more about the website. <br>
    The layout settings page. Here you can change the appearance of the website. Note that these settings will be reset when you leave the website. <br>
    In the future I will add some way to have your settings saved locally. <br>
    The text to speech voice settings page. Here you can change the text to speech settings. <br>
    The leaderboards page. Here you can see the post number of boards that allow this number to be shown. <br>
    You can sort it by largest and smallest post numbers. <br>
    Eye bleach. It's there if you need it. <br>
    The legal page. Here you can read the terms and conditions. If you are a lawyer, please help me. <br><br>
    The medianon logo will take you straight to the home page. <br><br>
    The subscriptions page. Here you can see the threads you have subscribed to and nothing else. <br><br>
    The tabs function. It's a more compact subscriptions page that is available everywhere on the website. <br>
    The new tab button will store your current location and switch to a new tab on the home page. <br><br>
    The post history function. This shows the last post(s) you viewed. As it's off by default, you decide how many to store. <br><br>
    The bogo sort page. Here you can view a completely random post. If you want, you can visit that post. <br><br>
    The warning checkbox. If this box is ticked, trying to leave the site will show you a warning. <br>
    Use this to remind yourself to make a note of what you were doing before leaving. <br><br>
    The session log. A way of keeping track of how long you have been browsing medianon.

    <strong class="text-2xl">Boards:</strong><br>
    There are currently two types of boards: <br>
    Public and custom boards. These are completely free to make and use. <br>
    <strong>If this fact ever changes, consider the site to be compromised and stop using it.</strong><br><br>
    Except for public boards, all boards will be deleted thirty days after the last activity, <strong>no exceptions</strong>. <br><br>
    To access a board, type in its <strong>name</strong> on the home page and click enter. <br>
    If its password protected, type in the correct password to access it. <br><br>
    The search function will look through the title and content of the original post of every thread on that board. <br><br>
    Each board consists of two sections by default. These are 'live' and 'archive'. <br><br>
    <strong class="text-xl">Live</strong><br>
    You can only make a new thread or reply to a post in the live section. <br><br>
    After making a thread, it will stay in the live section for twenty four hours by default. After this time, it will be moved to the archive, <strong>no exceptions</strong>. <br><br>
    Each thread is displayed in the bump order by default. <br>
    When a thread is made, it goes to the top of the bump order. When a thread receives a reply, it goes to the top of the bump order. <br><br>
    Each board has a maximum of one hundred threads by default. <br><br>
    If the maximum number of threads exist and you make a new one, the thread at the bottom of the bump order gets deleted to make room for yours, <strong>no exceptions</strong>. <br><br><br>
    <strong class="text-xl">Archive</strong><br>
    After being archived, a thread will stay in the archive section for seven days by default. After this time, it will be deleted, <strong>no exceptions</strong>. <br><br>
    There are currently two sponsored posts on the main archive page, one at the top and one at the bottom. <br>
    As soon as I am able to, I will get rid of the top sponsored post. <br>
    This is the only place on medianon that you will see content you aren't looking for. <br>
    Each sponsored post will stay up for seven days and is first come first serve. <br>
